emacs-init-testbed
==================

An emacs repo for starting an emacs config, or testing a new one, or
both.

usage
-----

`./test.sh` runs emacs using the repo's config.

background
----------

The time has come to redo my emacs config. But I want to start
properly. So I made a repo designed as a emacs configuration testbed,
since this is also the ideal new config basis.
